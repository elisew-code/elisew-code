### 📌 Featured Project  
**📚 Personal Book Tracker**  
📊 I’m currently building a Flask web app with an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualises my personal library, book budget, and reading habits. It uses an SQLite database backend, Python for server-side logic, and HTML/CSS templates for the user interface. I plan to add user accounts soon, to share insights with other users!
