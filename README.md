## 🎓 Elise Walsh 

I’m a final-year Computer Science and Data Science student with a strong interest in data analysis and software development, including dashboards, visual storytelling, as well as intuitive applications and websites with a focus on user experience (UX). My interests extend to data engineering, particularly SQL, database optimisation, and automated data pipelines. I enjoy turning messy datasets into structured, useful insights and tools.

### 📌 Featured Project  
**📚 Personal Book Tracker (in development)**  
📊 A Flask web app with an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualises my personal library, book budget, and reading habits. It uses an SQLite database backend, Python for server-side logic, and HTML/CSS templates for the user interface. I plan to add user accounts to enable sharing of insights.
