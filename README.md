## 🎓 Elise Walsh 

I’m a Graduate Computer Science and Data Science student with a strong interest in data analysis and software development, including dashboards, visual storytelling, and intuitive applications and websites with a focus on user experience (UX). My interests extend to data engineering, particularly SQL, database optimisation, and automated data pipelines to support these tools.

### 📌 Featured Project
**📚 Personal Book Tracker** (*in development*) 

A Flask web app with an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualises my personal library, book budget, and reading habits. It uses an SQLite database backend populated with popular books and review data, Python for server-side logic, and HTML/CSS templates for the user interface. I plan to add user accounts to enable sharing of insights.
